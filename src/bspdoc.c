/* ***DESCRIPTION */

/*     Abstract */
/*         BSPDOC is a non-executable, B-spline documentary routine. */
/*         The narrative describes a B-spline and the routines */
/*         necessary to manipulate B-splines at a fairly high level. */
/*         The basic package described herein is that of reference */
/*         5 with names altered to prevent duplication and conflicts */
/*         with routines from reference 3.  The call lists used here */
/*         are also different.  Work vectors were added to ensure */
/*         portability and proper execution in an overlay environ- */
/*         ment.  These work arrays can be used for other purposes */
/*         except as noted in BSPVN.  While most of the original */
/*         routines in reference 5 were restricted to orders 20 */
/*         or less, this restriction was removed from all routines */
/*         except the quadrature routine BSQAD.  (See the section */
/*         below on differentiation and integration for details.) */

/*         The subroutines referenced below are single precision */
/*         routines.  Corresponding double precision versions are also */
/*         part of the package, and these are referenced by prefixing */
/*         a D in front of the single precision name.  For example, */
/*         BVALU and DBVALU are the single and double precision */
/*         versions for evaluating a B-spline or any of its deriva- */
/*         tives in the B-representation. */

/*                ****Description of B-Splines**** */

/*     A collection of polynomials of fixed degree K-1 defined on a */
/*     subdivision (X(I),X(I+1)), I=1,...,M-1 of (A,B) with X(1)=A, */
/*     X(M)=B is called a B-spline of order K.  If the spline has K-2 */
/*     continuous derivatives on (A,B), then the B-spline is simply */
/*     called a spline of order K.  Each of the M-1 polynomial pieces */
/*     has K coefficients, making a total of K(M-1) parameters.  This */
/*     B-spline and its derivatives have M-2 jumps at the subdivision */
/*     points X(I), I=2,...,M-1.  Continuity requirements at these */
/*     subdivision points add constraints and reduce the number of free */
/*     parameters.  If a B-spline is continuous at each of the M-2 sub- */
/*     division points, there are K(M-1)-(M-2) free parameters; if in */
/*     addition the B-spline has continuous first derivatives, there */
/*     are K(M-1)-2(M-2) free parameters, etc., until we get to a */
/*     spline where we have K(M-1)-(K-1)(M-2) = M+K-2 free parameters. */
/*     Thus, the principle is that increasing the continuity of */
/*     derivatives decreases the number of free parameters and */
/*     conversely. */

/*     The points at which the polynomials are tied together by the */
/*     continuity conditions are called knots.  If two knots are */
/*     allowed to come together at some X(I), then we say that we */
/*     have a knot of multiplicity 2 there, and the knot values are */
/*     the X(I) value.  If we reverse the procedure of the first */
/*     paragraph, we find that adding a knot to increase multiplicity */
/*     increases the number of free parameters and, according to the */
/*     principle above, we thereby introduce a discontinuity in what */
/*     was the highest continuous derivative at that knot.  Thus, the */
/*     number of free parameters is N = NU+K-2 where NU is the sum */
/*     of multiplicities at the X(I) values with X(1) and X(M) of */
/*     multiplicity 1 (NU = M if all knots are simple, i.e., for a */
/*     spline, all knots have multiplicity 1.)  Each knot can have a */
/*     multiplicity of at most K.  A B-spline is commonly written in the */
/*     B-representation */

/*               Y(X) = sum( A(I)*B(I,X), I=1 , N) */

/*     to show the explicit dependence of the spline on the free */
/*     parameters or coefficients A(I)=BCOEF(I) and basis functions */
/*     B(I,X).  These basis functions are themselves special B-splines */
/*     which are zero except on (at most) K adjoining intervals where */
/*     each B(I,X) is positive and, in most cases, hat or bell- */
/*     shaped.  In order for the nonzero part of B(1,X) to be a spline */
/*     covering (X(1),X(2)), it is necessary to put K-1 knots to the */
/*     left of A and similarly for B(N,X) to the right of B.  Thus, the */
/*     total number of knots for this representation is NU+2K-2 = N+K. */
/*     These knots are carried in an array T(*) dimensioned by at least */
/*     N+K.  From the construction, A=T(K) and B=T(N+1) and the spline is */
/*     defined on T(K).LE.X.LE.T(N+1).  The nonzero part of each basis */
/*     function lies in the  Interval (T(I),T(I+K)).  In many problems */
/*     where extrapolation beyond A or B is not anticipated, it is common */
/*     practice to set T(1)=T(2)=...=T(K)=A and T(N+1)=T(N+2)=...= */
/*     T(N+K)=B.  In summary, since T(K) and T(N+1) as well as */
/*     interior knots can have multiplicity K, the number of free */
/*     parameters N = sum of multiplicities - K.  The fact that each */
/*     B(I,X) function is nonzero over at most K intervals means that */
/*     for a given X value, there are at most K nonzero terms of the */
/*     sum.  This leads to banded matrices in linear algebra problems, */
/*     and references 3 and 6 take advantage of this in con- */
/*     structing higher level routines to achieve speed and avoid */
/*     ill-conditioning. */

/*                     ****Basic Routines**** */

/*     The basic routines which most casual users will need are those */
/*     concerned with direct evaluation of splines or B-splines. */
/*     Since the B-representation, denoted by (T,BCOEF,N,K), is */
/*     preferred because of numerical stability, the knots T(*), the */
/*     B-spline coefficients BCOEF(*), the number of coefficients N, */
/*     and the order K of the polynomial pieces (of degree K-1) are */
/*     usually given.  While the knot array runs from T(1) to T(N+K), */
/*     the B-spline is normally defined on the interval T(K).LE.X.LE. */
/*     T(N+1).  To evaluate the B-spline or any of its derivatives */
/*     on this interval, one can use */

/*                  Y = BVALU(T,BCOEF,N,K,ID,X,INBV,WORK) */

/*     where ID is an integer for the ID-th derivative, 0.LE.ID.LE.K-1. */
/*     ID=0 gives the zero-th derivative or B-spline value at X. */
/*     If X.LT.T(K) or X.GT.T(N+1), whether by mistake or the result */
/*     of round off accumulation in incrementing X, BVALU gives a */
/*     diagnostic.  INBV is an initialization parameter which is set */
/*     to 1 on the first call.  Distinct splines require distinct */
/*     INBV parameters.  WORK is a scratch vector of length at least */
/*     3*K. */

/*     When more conventional communication is needed for publication, */
/*     physical interpretation, etc., the B-spline coefficients can */
/*     be converted to piecewise polynomial (PP) coefficients.  Thus, */
/*     the breakpoints (distinct knots) XI(*), the number of */
/*     polynomial pieces LXI, and the (right) derivatives C(*,J) at */
/*     each breakpoint XI(J) are needed to define the Taylor */
/*     expansion to the right of XI(J) on each interval XI(J).LE. */
/*     X.LT.XI(J+1), J=1,LXI where XI(1)=A and XI(LXI+1)=B. */
/*     These are obtained from the (T,BCOEF,N,K) representation by */

/*                CALL BSPPP(T,BCOEF,N,K,LDC,C,XI,LXI,WORK) */

/*     where LDC.GE.K is the leading dimension of the matrix C and */
/*     WORK is a scratch vector of length at least K*(N+3). */
/*     Then the PP-representation (C,XI,LXI,K) of Y(X), denoted */
/*     by Y(J,X) on each interval XI(J).LE.X.LT.XI(J+1), is */

/*     Y(J,X) = sum( C(I,J)*((X-XI(J))**(I-1))/factorial(I-1), I=1,K) */

/*     for J=1,...,LXI.  One must view this conversion from the B- */
/*     to the PP-representation with some skepticism because the */
/*     conversion may lose significant digits when the B-spline */
/*     varies in an almost discontinuous fashion.  To evaluate */
/*     the B-spline or any of its derivatives using the PP- */
/*     representation, one uses */

/*                Y = PPVAL(LDC,C,XI,LXI,K,ID,X,INPPV) */

/*     where ID and INPPV have the same meaning and usage as ID and */
/*     INBV in BVALU. */

/*     To determine to what extent the conversion process loses */
/*     digits, compute the relative error ABS((Y1-Y2)/Y2) over */
/*     the X interval with Y1 from PPVAL and Y2 from BVALU.  A */
/*     major reason for considering PPVAL is that evaluation is */
/*     much faster than that from BVALU. */

/*     Recall that when multiple knots are encountered, jump type */
/*     discontinuities in the B-spline or its derivatives occur */
/*     at these knots, and we need to know that BVALU and PPVAL */
/*     return right limiting values at these knots except at */
/*     X=B where left limiting values are returned.  These values */
/*     are used for the Taylor expansions about left end points of */
/*     breakpoint intervals.  That is, the derivatives C(*,J) are */
/*     right derivatives.  Note also that a computed X value which, */
/*     mathematically, would be a knot value may differ from the knot */
/*     by a round off error.  When this happens in evaluating a dis- */
/*     continuous B-spline or some discontinuous derivative, the */
/*     value at the knot and the value at X can be radically */
/*     different.  In this case, setting X to a T or XI value makes */
/*     the computation precise.  For left limiting values at knots */
/*     other than X=B, see the prologues to BVALU and other */
/*     routines. */

/*                     ****Interpolation**** */

/*     BINTK is used to generate B-spline parameters (T,BCOEF,N,K) */
/*     which will interpolate the data by calls to BVALU.  A similar */
/*     interpolation can also be done for cubic splines using BINT4 */
/*     or the code in reference 7.  If the PP-representation is given, */
/*     one can evaluate this representation at an appropriate number of */
/*     abscissas to create data then use BINTK or BINT4 to generate */
/*     the B-representation. */

/*               ****Differentiation and Integration**** */

/*     Derivatives of B-splines are obtained from BVALU or PPVAL. */
/*     Integrals are obtained from BSQAD using the B-representation */
/*     (T,BCOEF,N,K) and PPQAD using the PP-representation (C,XI,LXI, */
/*     K).  More complicated integrals involving the product of a */
/*     of a function F and some derivative of a B-spline can be */
/*     evaluated with BFQAD or PFQAD using the B- or PP- represen- */
/*     tations respectively.  All quadrature routines, except for PPQAD, */
/*     are limited in accuracy to 18 digits or working precision, */
/*     whichever is smaller.  PPQAD is limited to working precision */
/*     only.  In addition, the order K for BSQAD is limited to 20 or */
/*     less.  If orders greater than 20 are required, use BFQAD with */
/*     F(X) = 1. */

/*                      ****Extrapolation**** */

/*     Extrapolation outside the interval (A,B) can be accomplished */
/*     easily by the PP-representation using PPVAL.  However, */
/*     caution should be exercised, especially when several knots */
/*     are located at A or B or when the extrapolation is carried */
/*     significantly beyond A or B.  On the other hand, direct */
/*     evaluation with BVALU outside A=T(K).LE.X.LE.T(N+1)=B */
/*     produces an error message, and some manipulation of the knots */
/*     and coefficients are needed to extrapolate with BVALU.  This */
/*     process is described in reference 6. */

/*                ****Curve Fitting and Smoothing**** */

/*     Unless one has many accurate data points, direct inter- */
/*     polation is not recommended for summarizing data.  The */
/*     results are often not in accordance with intuition since the */
/*     fitted curve tends to oscillate through the set of points. */
/*     Monotone splines (reference 7) can help curb this undulating */
/*     tendency but constrained least squares is more likely to give an */
/*     acceptable fit with fewer parameters.  Subroutine FC, des- */
/*     cribed in reference 6, is recommended for this purpose.  The */
/*     output from this fitting process is the B-representation. */

/*              **** Routines in the B-Spline Package **** */

/*                      Single Precision Routines */

/*         The subroutines referenced below are SINGLE PRECISION */
/*         routines. Corresponding DOUBLE PRECISION versions are also */
/*         part of the package and these are referenced by prefixing */
