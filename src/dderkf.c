/*        You have a choice of three differential equation solvers from */
/*        DDEPAC.  The following brief descriptions are meant to aid you */
/*        in choosing the most appropriate code for your problem. */

/*        DDERKF is a fifth order Runge-Kutta code. It is the simplest of */
/*        the three choices, both algorithmically and in the use of the */
/*        code. DDERKF is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and mild- */
/*        ly stiff differential equations when derivative evaluations are */
/*        not expensive.  It should generally not be used to get high */
/*        accuracy results nor answers at a great many specific points. */
/*        Because DDERKF has very low overhead costs, it will usually */
/*        result in the least expensive integration when solving */
/*        problems requiring a modest amount of accuracy and having */
/*        equations that are not costly to evaluate.  DDERKF attempts to */
/*        discover when it is not suitable for the task posed. */

/*        DDEABM is a variable order (one through twelve) Adams code. Its */
/*        complexity lies somewhere between that of DDERKF and DDEBDF. */
/*        DDEABM is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and mildly */
/*        stiff differential equations when derivative evaluations are */
/*        expensive, high accuracy results are needed or answers at */
/*        many specific points are required.  DDEABM attempts to discover */
/*        when it is not suitable for the task posed. */

/*        DDEBDF is a variable order (one through five) backward */
/*        differentiation formula code.  It is the most complicated of */
/*        the three choices.  DDEBDF is primarily designed to solve stiff */
/*        differential equations at crude to moderate tolerances. */
/*        If the problem is very stiff at all, DDERKF and DDEABM will be */
/*        quite inefficient compared to DDEBDF.  However, DDEBDF will be */
/*        inefficient compared to DDERKF and DDEABM on non-stiff problems */
/*        because it uses much more storage, has a much larger overhead, */
/*        and the low order formulas will not give high accuracies */
/*        efficiently. */

/*        The concept of stiffness cannot be described in a few words. */
/*        If you do not know the problem to be stiff, try either DDERKF */
/*        or DDEABM.  Both of these codes will inform you of stiffness */
/*        when the cost of solving such problems becomes important. */

/* ** ABSTRACT ** */
/* ********************************************************************** */

/*   Subroutine DDERKF uses a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (4,5) method to */
/*   integrate a system of NEQ first order ordinary differential */
/*   equations of the form */
/*                         DU/DX = DF(X,U) */
/*   when the vector Y(*) of initial values for U(*) at X=T is given. */
/*   The subroutine integrates from T to TOUT. It is easy to continue the */
/*   integration to get results at additional TOUT.  This is the interval */
/*   mode of operation.  It is also easy for the routine to return with */
/*   the solution at each intermediate step on the way to TOUT.  This is */
/*   the intermediate-output mode of operation. */

/*   DDERKF uses subprograms DRKFS, DFEHL, DHSTRT, DHVNRM, D1MACH, and */
/*   the error handling routine XERMSG. The only machine dependent */
/*   parameters to be assigned appear in D1MACH. */

/* ********************************************************************** */
/* ** DESCRIPTION OF THE ARGUMENTS TO DDERKF (AN OVERVIEW) ** */
/* ********************************************************************** */

/*   The Parameters are: */

/*      DF -- This is the name of a subroutine which you provide to */
/*             define the differential equations. */

/*      NEQ -- This is the number of (first order) differential */
/*             equations to be integrated. */

/*      T -- This is a DOUBLE PRECISION value of the independent */
/*           variable. */

/*      Y(*) -- This DOUBLE PRECISION array contains the solution */
/*              components at T. */

/*      TOUT -- This is a DOUBLE PRECISION point at which a solution is */
/*              desired. */

/*      INFO(*) -- The basic task of the code is to integrate the */
/*             differential equations from T to TOUT and return an */
/*             answer at TOUT.  INFO(*) is an INTEGER array which is used */
/*             to communicate exactly how you want this task to be */
/*             carried out. */

/*      RTOL, ATOL -- These DOUBLE PRECISION quantities represent */
/*             relative and absolute error tolerances which you provide */
/*             to indicate how accurately you wish the solution to be */
/*             computed. You may choose them to be both scalars or else */
/*             both vectors. */

/*      IDID -- This scalar quantity is an indicator reporting what */
/*             the code did.  You must monitor this INTEGER variable to */
/*             decide what action to take next. */

/*      RWORK(*), LRW -- RWORK(*) is a DOUBLE PRECISION work array of */
/*             length LRW which provides the code with needed storage */
/*             space. */

/*      IWORK(*), LIW -- IWORK(*) is an INTEGER work array of length LIW */
/*             which provides the code with needed storage space and an */
/*             across call flag. */

/*      RPAR, IPAR -- These are DOUBLE PRECISION and INTEGER parameter */
/*             arrays which you can use for communication between your */
/*             calling program and the DF subroutine. */

/*  Quantities which are used as input items are */
/*             NEQ, T, Y(*), TOUT, INFO(*), */
/*             RTOL, ATOL, LRW and LIW. */

/*  Quantities which may be altered by the code are */
/*             T, Y(*), INFO(1), RTOL, ATOL, */
/*             IDID, RWORK(*) and IWORK(*). */

/* ********************************************************************** */
/* ** INPUT -- What to do On The First Call To DDERKF ** */
/* ********************************************************************** */

/*   The first call of the code is defined to be the start of each new */
/*   problem.  Read through the descriptions of all the following items, */
/*   provide sufficient storage space for designated arrays, set */
/*   appropriate variables for the initialization of the problem, and */
/*   give information about how you want the problem to be solved. */


/*      DF -- Provide a subroutine of the form */
/*                               DF(X,U,UPRIME,RPAR,IPAR) */
/*             to define the system of first order differential equations */
/*             which is to be solved.  For the given values of X and the */
/*             vector  U(*)=(U(1),U(2),...,U(NEQ)) , the subroutine must */
/*             evaluate the NEQ components of the system of differential */
/*             equations  DU/DX=DF(X,U)  and store the derivatives in the */
/*             array UPRIME(*), that is,  UPRIME(I) = * DU(I)/DX *  for */
/*             equations I=1,...,NEQ. */

/*             Subroutine DF must not alter X or U(*). You must declare */
/*             the name DF in an external statement in your program that */
/*             calls DDERKF. You must dimension U and UPRIME in DF. */

/*             RPAR and IPAR are DOUBLE PRECISION and INTEGER parameter */
/*             arrays which you can use for communication between your */
/*             calling program and subroutine DF. They are not used or */
/*             altered by DDERKF.  If you do not need RPAR or IPAR, */
/*             ignore these parameters by treating them as dummy */
/*             arguments. If you do choose to use them, dimension them in */
/*             your calling program and in DF as arrays of appropriate */
/*             length. */

/*      NEQ -- Set it to the number of differential equations. */
/*             (NEQ .GE. 1) */

/*      T -- Set it to the initial point of the integration. */
/*             You must use a program variable for T because the code */
/*             changes its value. */

/*      Y(*) -- Set this vector to the initial values of the NEQ solution */
/*             components at the initial point.  You must dimension Y at */
/*             least NEQ in your calling program. */

/*      TOUT -- Set it to the first point at which a solution */
/*             is desired.  You can take TOUT = T, in which case the code */
/*             will evaluate the derivative of the solution at T and */
/*             return.  Integration either forward in T  (TOUT .GT. T) or */
/*             backward in T  (TOUT .LT. T)  is permitted. */

/*             The code advances the solution from T to TOUT using */
/*             step sizes which are automatically selected so as to */
/*             achieve the desired accuracy.  If you wish, the code will */
/*             return with the solution and its derivative following */
/*             each intermediate step (intermediate-output mode) so that */
/*             you can monitor them, but you still must provide TOUT in */
/*             accord with the basic aim of the code. */

/*             The first step taken by the code is a critical one */
/*             because it must reflect how fast the solution changes near */
/*             the initial point.  The code automatically selects an */
/*             initial step size which is practically always suitable for */
/*             the problem.  By using the fact that the code will not */
/*             step past TOUT in the first step, you could, if necessary, */
/*             restrict the length of the initial step size. */

/*             For some problems it may not be permissible to integrate */
/*             past a point TSTOP because a discontinuity occurs there */
/*             or the solution or its derivative is not defined beyond */
/*             TSTOP.  Since DDERKF will never step past a TOUT point, */
/*             you need only make sure that no TOUT lies beyond TSTOP. */

/*      INFO(*) -- Use the INFO array to give the code more details about */
/*             how you want your problem solved.  This array should be */
/*             dimensioned of length 15 to accommodate other members of */
/*             DEPAC or possible future extensions, though DDERKF uses */
/*             only the first three entries.  You must respond to all of */
/*             the following items which are arranged as questions.  The */
/*             simplest use of the code corresponds to answering all */
/*             questions as YES ,i.e. setting all entries of INFO to 0. */

/*        INFO(1) -- This parameter enables the code to initialize */
/*               itself.  You must set it to indicate the start of every */
/*               new problem. */

/*            **** Is this the first call for this problem ... */
/*                  YES -- Set INFO(1) = 0 */
/*                   NO -- Not applicable here. */
/*                         See below for continuation calls.  **** */

/*        INFO(2) -- How much accuracy you want of your solution */
/*               is specified by the error tolerances RTOL and ATOL. */
/*               The simplest use is to take them both to be scalars. */
/*               To obtain more flexibility, they can both be vectors. */
/*               The code must be told your choice. */

/*            **** Are both error tolerances RTOL, ATOL scalars ... */
/*                  YES -- Set INFO(2) = 0 */
/*                         and input scalars for both RTOL and ATOL */
/*                   NO -- Set INFO(2) = 1 */
/*                         and input arrays for both RTOL and ATOL **** */

/*        INFO(3) -- The code integrates from T in the direction */
/*               of TOUT by steps.  If you wish, it will return the */
/*               computed solution and derivative at the next */
/*               intermediate step (the intermediate-output mode). */
/*               This is a good way to proceed if you want to see the */
/*               behavior of the solution.  If you must have solutions at */
/*               a great many specific TOUT points, this code is */
/*               INEFFICIENT.  The code DDEABM in DEPAC handles this task */
/*               more efficiently. */

/*            **** Do you want the solution only at */
/*                 TOUT (and not at the next intermediate step) ... */
/*                  YES -- Set INFO(3) = 0 */
/*                   NO -- Set INFO(3) = 1 **** */

/*      RTOL, ATOL -- You must assign relative (RTOL) and absolute (ATOL) */
/*             error tolerances to tell the code how accurately you want */
/*             the solution to be computed.  They must be defined as */
/*             program variables because the code may change them.  You */
/*             have two choices -- */
/*                  Both RTOL and ATOL are scalars. (INFO(2)=0) */
/*                  Both RTOL and ATOL are vectors. (INFO(2)=1) */
/*             In either case all components must be non-negative. */

/*             The tolerances are used by the code in a local error test */
/*             at each step which requires roughly that */
/*                     ABS(LOCAL ERROR) .LE. RTOL*ABS(Y)+ATOL */
/*             for each vector component. */
/*             (More specifically, a maximum norm is used to measure */
/*             the size of vectors, and the error test uses the average */
/*             of the magnitude of the solution at the beginning and end */
/*             of the step.) */

/*             The true (global) error is the difference between the true */
/*             solution of the initial value problem and the computed */
/*             approximation.  Practically all present day codes, */
/*             including this one, control the local error at each step */
/*             and do not even attempt to control the global error */
/*             directly.  Roughly speaking, they produce a solution Y(T) */
/*             which satisfies the differential equations with a */
/*             residual R(T),    DY(T)/DT = DF(T,Y(T)) + R(T)   , */
/*             and, almost always, R(T) is bounded by the error */
/*             tolerances.  Usually, but not always, the true accuracy of */
/*             the computed Y is comparable to the error tolerances. This */
/*             code will usually, but not always, deliver a more accurate */
/*             solution if you reduce the tolerances and integrate again. */
/*             By comparing two such solutions you can get a fairly */
/*             reliable idea of the true error in the solution at the */
/*             bigger tolerances. */

/*             Setting ATOL=0. results in a pure relative error test on */
/*             that component.  Setting RTOL=0. yields a pure absolute */
/*             error test on that component.  A mixed test with non-zero */
/*             RTOL and ATOL corresponds roughly to a relative error */
/*             test when the solution component is much bigger than ATOL */
/*             and to an absolute error test when the solution component */
/*             is smaller than the threshold ATOL. */

/*             Proper selection of the absolute error control parameters */
/*             ATOL  requires you to have some idea of the scale of the */
/*             solution components.  To acquire this information may mean */
/*             that you will have to solve the problem more than once. In */
/*             the absence of scale information, you should ask for some */
/*             relative accuracy in all the components (by setting  RTOL */
/*             values non-zero) and perhaps impose extremely small */
/*             absolute error tolerances to protect against the danger of */
/*             a solution component becoming zero. */

/*             The code will not attempt to compute a solution at an */
/*             accuracy unreasonable for the machine being used.  It will */
/*             advise you if you ask for too much accuracy and inform */
/*             you as to the maximum accuracy it believes possible. */
/*             If you want relative accuracies smaller than about */
/*             10**(-8), you should not ordinarily use DDERKF. The code */
/*             DDEABM in DEPAC obtains stringent accuracies more */
/*             efficiently. */

/*      RWORK(*) -- Dimension this DOUBLE PRECISION work array of length */
/*             LRW in your calling program. */

/*      LRW -- Set it to the declared length of the RWORK array. */
/*             You must have  LRW .GE. 33+7*NEQ */

/*      IWORK(*) -- Dimension this INTEGER work array of length LIW in */
/*             your calling program. */

/*      LIW -- Set it to the declared length of the IWORK array. */
/*             You must have  LIW .GE. 34 */

/*      RPAR, IPAR -- These are parameter arrays, of DOUBLE PRECISION and */
/*             INTEGER type, respectively. You can use them for */
/*             communication between your program that calls DDERKF and */
/*             the  DF subroutine. They are not used or altered by */
/*             DDERKF. If you do not need RPAR or IPAR, ignore these */
/*             parameters by treating them as dummy arguments. If you do */
/*             choose to use them, dimension them in your calling program */
/*             and in DF as arrays of appropriate length. */

/* *Long Description: */

/* ********************************************************************** */
/* **             DEPAC Package Overview           ** */
/* ********************************************************************** */

/* ....   You have a choice of three differential equation solvers from */
/* ....   DEPAC. The following brief descriptions are meant to aid you in */
/* ....   choosing the most appropriate code for your problem. */

/* ....   DDERKF is a fifth order Runge-Kutta code. It is the simplest of */
/* ....   the three choices, both algorithmically and in the use of the */
/* ....   code. DDERKF is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and */
/* ....   mildly stiff differential equations when derivative evaluations */
/* ....   are not expensive. It should generally not be used to get high */
/* ....   accuracy results nor answers at a great many specific points. */
/* ....   Because DDERKF has very low overhead costs, it will usually */
/* ....   result in the least expensive integration when solving */
/* ....   problems requiring a modest amount of accuracy and having */
/* ....   equations that are not costly to evaluate. DDERKF attempts to */
/* ....   discover when it is not suitable for the task posed. */

/* ....   DDEABM is a variable order (one through twelve) Adams code. */
/* ....   Its complexity lies somewhere between that of DDERKF and */
/* ....   DDEBDF.  DDEABM is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and */
/* ....   mildly stiff differential equations when derivative evaluations */
/* ....   are expensive, high accuracy results are needed or answers at */
/* ....   many specific points are required. DDEABM attempts to discover */
/* ....   when it is not suitable for the task posed. */

/* ....   DDEBDF is a variable order (one through five) backward */
/* ....   differentiation formula code. it is the most complicated of */
/* ....   the three choices. DDEBDF is primarily designed to solve stiff */
/* ....   differential equations at crude to moderate tolerances. */
/* ....   If the problem is very stiff at all, DDERKF and DDEABM will be */
/* ....   quite inefficient compared to DDEBDF. However, DDEBDF will be */
/* ....   inefficient compared to DDERKF and DDEABM on non-stiff problems */
/* ....   because it uses much more storage, has a much larger overhead, */
/* ....   and the low order formulas will not give high accuracies */
/* ....   efficiently. */

/* ....   The concept of stiffness cannot be described in a few words. */
/* ....   If you do not know the problem to be stiff, try either DDERKF */
/* ....   or DDEABM. Both of these codes will inform you of stiffness */
/* ....   when the cost of solving such problems becomes important. */
