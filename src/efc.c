/* ***DESCRIPTION */

/*      This subprogram fits a piecewise polynomial curve */
/*      to discrete data.  The piecewise polynomials are */
/*      represented as B-splines. */
/*      The fitting is done in a weighted least squares sense. */

/*      The data can be processed in groups of modest size. */
/*      The size of the group is chosen by the user.  This feature */
/*      may be necessary for purposes of using constrained curve fitting */
/*      with subprogram FC( ) on a very large data set. */

/*      For a description of the B-splines and usage instructions to */
/*      evaluate them, see */
